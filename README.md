#Password GeneratorðŸ”¥

To create a password with Python, we need to create a program that takes the length of the password and generates a random password of the same length apart from this our program also generates as many passwords as we want with same length.
ðŸ“ŒPython Program to Generate Password:-
~To write a Python program to create a password, declare a string of numbers + uppercase + lowercase + special characters. Take a random sample of the string of a length given by the user.

~In the above code, I first imported the random module in Python, then I asked for user input for the amount of the password he/she want. After that I asked for user input for the length of the password. Then I use a for loop here which should run as many times as many times we want amount of password generated.

~Then in the for loop I created a variable named as "Passwords" and define it with blank string. Then again I'm using a for loop here which should run as many times as length of password we want. After that I stored the letters, numbers and special characters that I want to be considered while generating a password which will finally generate a random password and prints it.

ðŸ“ŒSummary:-

~There are a few areas where the above code could be improved upon, but at a basic level, it meets many secure password generation requirements by todayâ€™s standards. As a newbie to Python or any other language, you should keep trying these types of programs as they help you explore more functions and in the long run will help you design your algorithms.
